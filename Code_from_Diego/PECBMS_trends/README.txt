In this folder you find two types of files (three files in total).

1. Two CSV:
- PECBMS_species_list_2022: PECBMS does not want all species recorded in Norway but those species that are relevant at European scale. The species we report to PECBMS are listed here.
- ReportSpeciesPECBMS2020: Table with some information provided by John Atle were it states the starting year (base year) for the calculations of the trend indexes each species.

2. One R file.
- Full_PECBMS_code_for_Chloe: contains the full script with code that gathers bird data from the data base (hekkefugloverv√•king), cleans and formats the data, and run the rtrim-shell provided by PECBMS. The end result are the files required by PECBMS (i.e. the files we submit to PECBMS as part of the European common bird monitoring)
